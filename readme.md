- Default Methods in interfaces

  - What are default methods?

    - Before Java 8, we could only declare abstract methods in an interface. However, Java 8 introduced the concept of default methods. Default methods are methods that can have a body. The most important use of default methods in interfaces is to provide additional functionality to a given type without breaking down the implementing classes.

    - Before Java 8, if a new method was introduced in an interface then all the implementing classes used to break. We would need to provide the implementation of that method in all the implementing classes.
